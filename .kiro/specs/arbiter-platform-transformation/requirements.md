# Arbiter Platform Transformation - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Arbiter Platform Transformation project aims to evolve the current CrawlGuard WordPress plugin into a comprehensive, enterprise-grade platform for AI content monetization. This transformation addresses the growing need for a scalable, multi-tenant solution that can serve both individual content creators and large enterprises while facilitating ethical AI training data acquisition.

The platform will serve as a two-sided marketplace connecting content publishers (supply side) with AI companies (demand side), enabling transparent, permission-based content licensing with automated enforcement and real-time analytics.
