## 🔧 Configuration Details

### Environment Setup
- Using production API: `https://api.paypercrawl.tech/v1`
- Cloudflare Worker: `https://crawlguard-api-prod.crawlguard-api.workers.dev`
- Database: Neon PostgreSQL (configured for read-only test access)
- Feature flags enabled for testing

### Test Coverage Thresholds
- Statements: 80%
- Branches: 75%
- Functions: 80%
- Lines: 80%

## ⚠️ Pending Setup (Optional)

### PHP Testing (Requires Manual Installation)
To enable PHP testing capabilities:

1. **Install Composer**
   ```bash
   # Download from https://getcomposer.org/download/
   # Or use Chocolatey:
   choco install composer
   ```

2. **Install PHP dependencies**
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Run PHP tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test:php
   ```

### WordPress Admin Credentials
For E2E WordPress admin tests, update in `.env.test`:
- `WP_ADMIN_USER` - WordPress admin username
- `WP_ADMIN_PASS` - WordPress admin password

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit          # Unit tests
npm run test:e2e           # E2E tests
npm run test:coverage      # With coverage

# Run test orchestrator
node tests/run-tests.js

# View E2E test report
npm run playwright:report
```

## 📊 Test Reporting

Test results and coverage reports are saved to:
- `tests/coverage/jest/` - Jest coverage reports
- `tests/coverage/playwright/` - Playwright test reports
- `tests/coverage/phpunit/` - PHPUnit coverage (when available)
- `tests/logs/` - Test execution logs

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Write additional test cases for existing functionality
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
3. Install Composer for PHP testing capabilities
4. Configure test database for integration testing
5. Add more E2E test scenarios

## 📝 Notes

- All JavaScript and E2E testing capabilities are fully functional
- PHP testing requires Composer installation (optional)
- Test environment uses existing production credentials from .env
- Bot detection tests are configured and ready to use
- Coverage reporting is automatically generated
