## Why CrawlGuard Exists

### The Problem We Solve

In 2024, AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google are training their models on web content without compensating content creators. Your valuable content is being used to train AI models that generate billions in revenue, while you receive nothing in return.

**CrawlGuard changes this equation.**

## Core Functionality

- **95% Accuracy Rate** using machine learning algorithms
- **Real-time Detection** of 23+ known AI training bots
- **Pattern Recognition** to identify new and unknown bots
- **User Agent Analysis** with advanced fingerprinting

### 2. Content Monetization
- **Pay-per-Access Model**: Charge AI companies for accessing your content
- **Dynamic Pricing**: $0.001-$0.002 per request based on content value
- **Automated Billing**: Stripe Connect integration for seamless payments
- **Revenue Sharing**: 75-85% to site owners, 15-25% platform fee

### 3. Content Protection
- **Selective Access**: Allow/block specific bots
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent aggressive crawling
- **Content Obfuscation**: Scramble content for unauthorized bots
- **Legal Compliance**: DMCA and copyright protection features
